Today came in for an appointment was seen late, I had another appointment straight after so because of being seen late, made me late for next appointment and they rang me to see where I was because I had booked in online! Prescription was issued and sent to pharmacy which I was told would be delivered to me because I couldn’t get back there (due to condition I went there for) nothing arrived so rang surgery, 15 minutes to get through at number 1, again! Only to be told ring the pharmacy, I did, pharmacy said it’s not ready that was from 10.50 am, till 6pm! And they don’t deliver, so am sitting here now wondering what to do and how I am going to get my prescription, thanks Audley Mills surgery and pharmacy",
